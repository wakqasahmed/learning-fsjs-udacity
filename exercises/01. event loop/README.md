# Instructions

In `index.js` you will see five `console.log` statements. Your goal is to have them log to the console in the order that they state without rearanging them. 

The output should look like this:
```bash
Print First
Print Second
Print Third
Print Forth
Print Fifth
```
Your solution should include one `console.log` left as is.

The other statements should use globals available within node.js to run the `console.log` statement at the appropriate time in the event loop. 

There are multiple ways to accomplish this, but you must **use at least three different methods**.

After you have written your code, run the `index.js` file using `node.js` to test your work.
